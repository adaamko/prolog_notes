## Example

```
?- setof(M,current_module(M),Modules).
Modules = [ansi_term,apply,apply_macros,base32,dcg_basics,editline,error|...].
```

## Sadly!

Sadly, this is **not at all** about getting the module of the currently executing code.

That's something that is just missing. Something like

=|this_module(M)|=

would be useful to get at the qualifier which may have to be passed to predicates in other modules.

## Do not be confused

Note that there is also a

[`current_module/2`](https://eu.swi-prolog.org/pldoc/doc_for?object=backward_compatibility%3Acurrent_module/2)

=|current_module(?Module, ?File)|= : True if Module is a module loaded from File.

which is a deprecated version of `module_property(Module, file(File))`
