From Covington et al., [Coding Guidelines for Prolog](https://arxiv.org/abs/0911.2899), page 10 and 11: _Decide how to format disjunctions and if-then-elses_

```
All but the simplest disjunctions should be displayed prominently using layouts such as

(
   disjunct_1
;
   disjunct_2
;
   disjunct_3
)

or the more compact

( disjunct_1
; disjunct_2
; disjunct_3
)

In both styles, parentheses are always present, the closing parenthesis is exactly
below the opening one, and the semicolons stick out in a way that makes misunderstanding much more difficult. 
```
