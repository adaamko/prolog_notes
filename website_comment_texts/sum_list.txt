As per a remark made on stack overflow, this predicate's name 

   - expresses what it does "sum the list" 
   - but does not express the order of its parameters, otherwise it would be called `list_sum/2`.

The predicate exhibits a bruti dataflow :

```
?- sum_list([1,2,X],6).
ERROR: Arguments are not sufficiently instantiated
```

This is also the same as

```
list_to_sum(L,Sum) :- foldl([X,FL,TR]>>(TR is X+FL),L,0,Sum).
```

There is no `mult_list/2` but one can easily add it:

```
list_to_product(L,Product) :- foldl([X,FL,TR]>>(TR is X*FL),L,1,Product).
```
